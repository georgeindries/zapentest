## Description
The user can open the application via a browser. After opening the application, the user must authenticate. If the user doesn't have an account can create one.<br/>
The user can perform spider and active scans.<br/>
Spider scans discover all the URLs related to the web app scanned.<br/>
Most of the time, testing the web app security doesn't consist of discovering new URLs but finding whether those URLs are vulnerable to attacks. To that end, the user can perform active scans. It is important to note that scanning a web app doesn't involve exploiting it but analyzing the responses received from that application after sending a myriad of requests.<br/>
The user can view the found vulnerabilities and details such as description and severity.<br/> 
Moreover, the user can access a dashboard showing statistics regarding the web application tested.<br/>
When the user decides to leave the application, they can sign out, coming back to the initial screen.</br>
